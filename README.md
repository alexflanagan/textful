A RESTful API for 3D Text Generation.

instructions
=======

1. npm install
1. pray, because we're on light brances of the dependency tree. On Mavericks I had to:
	1. install XQuartz-2.7.5
	1. install cairo (brew install cairo, iirc)
	1. set some environment vars (see ./install).
	1. maybe other things.
1. grunt
1. visit localhost:3000/text/hello.
1. change the url part after "text/" to change message.
